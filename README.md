A web and mobile app to track boba discounts! Currently optimised for my friends and I to use in Waterloo, but aiming to have support for other cities.

Built using Expo, with TypeScript and React. 

## Commands
So I remember how to build this project:
`npx expo start` start
`npm run deploy-hosting` deploy to https://so-boba-after.web.app/
`npx expo prebuild --platform android` - prebuild for android
`eas build --profile preview --platform android` - build for android
